# Game 1: Ancient egyptian calculator

In this Game, I wanted to play with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) in some creativity Way. 
In general, I like Egyptian Civilization and I decided to create some stuff about this Old culture. Egyptians used hieroglyphs to write.

This example show hieroglyph numbers in a View using Cards components from [Bootstrap V4 Alpha](http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/).

# Technical challenges

##Â How to write hieroglyphs in a Web Browser?
Unicode has a block for egyptian hieroglyphs, but this section is not managed in Web Browsers.

- http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U13000.pdf
- http://unicode-table.com/es/

So, to write a hieroglyph symbols in a web document, one alternative could be embedding the symbols in a webfonts. On Github, exist some examples to use hieroglyph with this approach, but the Javascript algorithms used on that libraries collide with the philosophy React.

This project renders Hieroglyph react components. In next weeks, I will add the following features:

- Add more range of numbers (0-1*10^6)
- Fractions
- Basic maths operations (Sum, Subtraction & Multiplication)
